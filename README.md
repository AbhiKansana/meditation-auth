This is an assignment project for a meditation startup. What this web app does is that checking if the user is authenticated or not. If yes then it will fetch user info from firebase firestore and then show it to the user otherwise it will take info from the user in the form and then upload it to the firestore. For state management, in this web app, I used redux and redux-thunk.
